### Usage

The SpeedDial widget is built to be placed in the `Scaffold.floatingActionButton` argument, replacing the `FloatingActionButton` widget.
You can set its position using `Scaffold.floatingActionButtonLocation` argument.
It can also be used with `Scaffold.bottomNavigationBar` and `Snackbar`.

**Null safety** is available from version **3.0.5** *( It is also backward compatible,  meaning you can use it with non null safe code too )*

#### Labels

SpeedDial can take any Widget as `label` *SpeedDial will use Extended FloatingActionButton property if label is specified*. It also have `activeLabel` property by which you can specify the label which is shown when SpeedDial is open. It also comes with its labelTransitionBuilder which defaults to fade transition.

Also Every child's button have `label` property which accepts `String` which can be styled by using `labelStyle`. If you want to specify a widget then you can use labelWidget.  
If the `label` parameter is not provided, then the label will be not rendered.

#### Handle spacing

There are various properties for SpeedDial by which you can adjust the spacing:

1. `spacing` - This parameter handles the space b/w speed dial and its children.

2. `spaceBetweenChildren` - As the name suggests, this is used to adjust the space b/w every child element

3. `childPadding` - This will adjust the padding of children speed dial button, this will help you to control the size of the children button more effectively.

4. `childMargin` - This will help you to adjust the margin b/w children speed dial button and its label.

#### Close on WillPop

Closes automatically on back button press, if dial is open.
If you don't want this behaviour then simply change the value of `closeDialOnPop` to false.

#### How to use `openCloseDial` property:

1. Create a value notifier named `isDialOpen`:
```dart
ValueNotifier<bool> isDialOpen = ValueNotifier(false);
```
2. Then set `openCloseDial` to `isDialOpen` in your `SpeedDial`:
```dart
SpeedDial(
  ...
  openCloseDial: isDialOpen,
  ...
)
```
3. Now you can change the state of dial open:
```dart
isDialOpen.value = false;
```

#### Example Usage

See [Example Code](example/lib/main.dart) for more info.
